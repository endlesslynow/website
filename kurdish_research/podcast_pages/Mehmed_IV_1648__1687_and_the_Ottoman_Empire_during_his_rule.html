It argues that the Sultan&#x27;s unique, detached style of rule—characterized by his focus on hunting and piety, earning him the moniker *Avcı*—allowed the powerful Köprülü dynasty of Grand Viziers to enact radical administrative and military reforms. This centralization of executive power led to a period of remarkable expansion, restoring Ottoman prestige through significant victories against Venice, the Habsburgs, and Poland, marking the empire&#x27;s greatest European extent. However, this same system was fatally flawed, culminating in the catastrophic military overreach at the Siege of Vienna in 1683, which initiated the Great Turkish War and led directly to Mehmed IV&#x27;s deposition and the empire’s irreversible geopolitical retreat.</p><a href="../docs/Mehmed IV and Ottoman Empire.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ Mehmed IV - Wikipedia, accessed October 14, 2025,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_IV</li>
