It explores the paradox of his position as a figurehead without temporal power, highlighting his intellectual and artistic background, which included mastery of painting and European culture. The text details the abolition of the Sultanate by the Grand National Assembly, which led to the unprecedented experiment of the &quot;Republican Caliphate&quot; before the spiritual office was itself abolished due to political tensions and perceived foreign interference, notably the &quot;Aga Khan Letter&quot;. Finally, the document recounts Abdulmejid II&#x27;s exile from Turkey and the decade-long struggle after his death for his body to be buried in Istanbul, ultimately resulting in his interment in Medina.</p><a href="../docs/Abdulmejid II and Ottoman Empire.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ Abdul Mejid II - New World Encyclopedia, accessed November 21, 2025,  https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Abdul_Mejid_II</li>
