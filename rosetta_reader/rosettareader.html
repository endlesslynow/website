ROSETTA READER ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
==================================

This is a language learning application. The application is split into multiple files for maintainability
and separation of concerns. I WILL NOT MAKE NEW FILES. ALL CHANGES AND ADDITIONS MUST BE MADE IN THIS FRAMEWORK!

FILE STRUCTURE AND RESPONSIBILITIES
---------------------------------

1. rosettareader.html (THIS FILE)
   - Serves as the application shell
   - Loads all required external dependencies (React, TailwindCSS, Firebase, Babel)
   - Provides the mount point (#language-learning-container)
   - Loads application files in the correct order
   - Initializes the React application

2. rr_firebase-config.js
   - Handles Firebase initialization and configuration
   - Creates and exports the database instance via window.rr_database
   - All Firebase interactions should go through this centralized configuration
   - Database is used for storing word definitions (structure: definitions/{word}: string)

3. rr_App.js
   - Main application component
   - Currently contains hardcoded sentences data
   - Designed to be the future home of:
     * Language selection interface
     * Text selection interface
     * Database context/state for selected language and text
     * Routing/display logic
   - Currently just passes sentences to LanguageLearningDisplay

4. rr_LanguageLearningDisplay.js
   - Core display component for the reading interface
   - Handles:
     * Displaying original text and translation
     * Word-level interaction and definition popup
     * Navigation between sentences
     * Definition storage and retrieval via Firebase
   - Receives sentences array as props, where each sentence has:
     * original: string (text in learning language)
     * translation: string (text in native language)

IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
------------------------------
- Components are exposed via window object due to the script loading approach
- Firebase database reference is shared via window.rr_database
- Tailwind is used for styling (via CDN)
- Babel is used for JSX transformation (via CDN)
- Mobile-responsive design is implemented
- Word definitions are stored in Firebase with lowercase keys

DATA STRUCTURES
--------------
1. Sentences Array:
   [{
     original: string,    // Text in learning language
     translation: string  // Text in native language
   }]

2. Definitions in Firebase:
   {
     "word": "definition" | { definition: "definition" }
   }

STYLING APPROACH
---------------
- TailwindCSS utility classes
- Fixed layout with dual panes (original text + translation)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Dark theme by default

This architecture is designed to be extended with new features while maintaining
clear separation of concerns and centralized state management.
