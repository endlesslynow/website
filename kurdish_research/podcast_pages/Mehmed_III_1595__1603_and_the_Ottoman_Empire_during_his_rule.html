The text first examines the Sultan&#x27;s paradoxical character, noting his piety and military victory at Keresztes, alongside his brutality in executing nineteen brothers and his own son to ensure dynastic security, thus becoming the last sultan trained under the traditional provincial system. Institutionally, the source analyzes how the pressures of the costly Long Turkish War in Europe and the devastating Jelali Rebellions in Anatolia—fueled by climate change, inflation, and the decline of the feudal *sipahi* cavalry—forced the collapse of the classical Ottoman state model. Ultimately, the report highlights the shift in governance toward the powerful Valide Sultan Safiye and the establishment of the Kafes confinement system for princes, signaling the definitive end of the old order and the forging of new, often fragile, 17th-century institutions.</p><a href="../docs/Mehmed III and Ottoman Empire Research.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ Ottomans.Org, accessed September 30, 2025,  http://www.theottomans.org/english/family/mehmet3.asp</li>
