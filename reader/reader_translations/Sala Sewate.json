      "10": "Girê Pozik is like a tent, its eastern side enclosed. It is located in the vicinity of the hill, where there were three threshing floors next to each other. South of the hill are the fields of the Berberojkan, those of Silqan and Zola of the house of Apê Hecî Emer, and the tilled fields reaching up to Xaçekê, which are considered vast, without stones or pebbles. The village, that is Zengê, was built on the slope of Girê Pozik. From after breakfast until sunset, the sun is in the houses, alleys, and streets of the village. Kurdish healers say, 'Where the sun enters a house, illness does not.' The houses of Zengê, too, bask in shafts of sunlight from morning until evening. Because the exterior of the houses and their plastering are of earth, they did not turn red. As soon as the sun sets, and with a few gusts, the village cools with the breeze from the forked valley. The wind blows on the village from three sides, not allowing contagious diseases to spread. The ancestor of the Zengis, Evdî Beg of the Badikîs, was an educated and scholarly man; he had considered and calculated many things for the health of the village's inhabitants and built the village with a plan. He planned it well, both against natural disasters and for the cleanliness of the village's surroundings. He knew how a clean climate keeps diseases away from the community, and he laid out the village's neighborhoods accordingly. The spring is below, but he built the houses six to seven hundred steps above, on the slope of the hill. The openings of the porches and the windows of the houses face west...",
"11": "...and they look to the west. The houses of Zengê, with their grain fields and vineyards, adorn three sides of Girê Pozik. Sturdy trees—oak, almond, pear, quince, acacia, poplar, aspen, and mulberry—immerse the surroundings of the village in green. The village houses are two-storied and made of flat, grey stones. The walls of the houses have buttresses and supports, carved corners, and tightly-fitted unpolished foundation stones; they are made of oak wood, while the doors of the lower courtyards are of walnut wood, studded with round-headed nails. The front of the porches is open, and in front of their openings, there are balconies (şaneşîn). The windows of the village rooms exist both in pairs and singly. The window frames and casings are of walnut, with carvings applied to the inside of the windows. On the outside, the well-off have used iron bars, while the others have used poplar wood. The water channel descends from the southern mountain, from the Tehtikê Valley, separates from the valley at Mêrga Jêrîn (Lower Meadow), passes below Pelan, goes eastward, and in the small Şiqêf valley, it turns into the fields of Gêwê. It passes below Welemir and behind Erzeleyêvay, comes and divides the village in two, and continues to below the Kirdan's mill, reaching the Path of the Bear's Slope, by the vineyard of the House of Diyaban. Besides the Lower and Upper neighborhoods, the Kirdan's mill is also located north of Pozik, east of the village, above the vast plain of Bane. To the east of Pozik are Silqan, Şewatîn hill, and Mewêrek; to the west, Diyarê Benê and Zolê; to the north, Kankolê hill, the vineyards of Mexer, and the region of Kerwes; to the south, Kevira Dugil and Binêzinar mountain, which looms over the plain of Amed like a giant, its peak reaching the base of the sky. From the plain, it is four hundred and sixty-six meters high. After Evdî Beg founded this village, the ancestors of the Zengis established four hundred and twenty place names in the mountains and fields in and around the village. Binê Guhara Heydo (Under Heydo's Poplar), Warê Lilan (The Lilan's Camp), Girê Qil (Ash Hill), Enbarê (The Granary), and Erdê Sor (The Red Earth) are a few of those names. During the war between Yawiz the Mustachioed (Sultan Selim I) and the Safavid Iranians, three sons of Evdî Beg from his younger wife—Osman, Brahîm, and Receb—came from the village of Kerran to the northeast of Farqîn, took the land from the Christians of Helhel, and founded Zengê. After that, they became three branches: the branch of the house of the Osmans, the Brahîms, and the Recebs. Feqî Eliyê of the House of Osman had five paternal uncles. His father Mehmûd was the eldest brother; Axayî came after him, and Emer was also Mehmûd's younger brother. Regarding the character and gallantry of the Axa, his older brother Mehmûd said: 'My brother's...'"
