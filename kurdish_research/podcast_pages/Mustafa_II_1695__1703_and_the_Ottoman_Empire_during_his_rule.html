The report details the Sultan&#x27;s personal ambition to revive the warrior-sultan role, which was initially met with success but led to the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Zenta in 1697. This military disaster resulted in the Sultan&#x27;s psychological withdrawal and the subsequent rise of corrupt, unaccountable rule, which directly caused the Edirne Incident of 1703 and his deposition. Crucially, the source identifies the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), which formalized massive territorial losses, as the definitive external marker of the empire&#x27;s irreversible geopolitical realignment and the beginning of the &quot;Eastern Question.&quot;</p><a href="../docs/Mustafa II and Ottoman Empire.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ Great Turkish War - Wikipedia, accessed October 14, 2025,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Turkish_War</li>
