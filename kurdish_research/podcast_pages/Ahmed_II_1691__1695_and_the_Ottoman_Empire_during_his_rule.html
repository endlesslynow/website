The sources primarily focus on the Kafes institution, a system of princely confinement that psychologically damaged future rulers and undermined state authority by creating inexperienced sultans, which in turn made Ahmed II heavily reliant on his Grand Vizier. Crucially, his reign was entirely consumed by the ongoing Great Turkish War, which led to the catastrophic loss of his vizier and main army at the Battle of Slankamen and caused profound fiscal distress. To manage the resulting budgetary deficit and fund the war, the administration introduced the malikâne system of lifelong tax farms, a policy that generated immediate cash but irrevocably accelerated the empire’s long-term decentralization and decline.</p><a href="../docs/Ottoman Empire Under Ahmed II.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ Sultans Raised in &#x27;Cages&#x27;: Overprotection Turned to Madness | Ancient Origins,  accessed October 14, 2025,  https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-ancient-traditions/sultan-0013392</li>
