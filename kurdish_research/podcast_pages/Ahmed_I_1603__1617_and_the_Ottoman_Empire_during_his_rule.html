The text details how internal upheaval, specifically the massive Jelali revolts in Anatolia, combined with costly two-front wars against the Habsburgs and the Safavids, fundamentally destabilized the state&#x27;s classical structure. Most significantly, Ahmed I abolished the dynastic tradition of fratricide, introducing the Kafes system and agnatic seniority, which permanently altered succession and weakened the personal power of future sultans. Furthermore, the source explains how fiscal insolvency drove the state to replace the timar system with exploitative tax-farming and that the Sultan&#x27;s political prestige, diminished by military defeats, was compensated for by grandiose architectural projects, such as the Blue Mosque. Ultimately, the fourteen-year reign marks the pivotal shift of the Ottoman state from an expansionist, patrimonial system to a more bureaucratic and decentralized one.</p><a href="../docs/Sultan Ahmed I and Ottoman Empire.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ MIGHTY SOVEREIGNS OF OTTOMAN THRONE: SULTAN AHMED I - Ekrem Buğra  Ekinci, accessed September 30, 2025,  https://www.ekrembugraekinci.com/article/?ID=1215&amp;mighty-sovereigns-of-otto man-throne:-sultan-ahmed-i</li>

<li>​When Ahmed&#x27;s father, Ehzade Mehmed, was just a prince and the governor of the  Sanjak of Manisa, he was most likely born on April 18, 1590, at the Manisa Palace in  Manisa. He has Handan Sultan as his mother. His father travelled to  Constantinople and assumed the title of Sultan Mehmed III after the death of his  grandfather Murad III in 1595. Mehmed gave the order to have his 19 half brothers  killed. Just before his own death on December 22, 1603, Mehmed also put  Ahmed&#x27;s older brother, Sehzade Mahmud, to death on June 7, 1603. Mahmud and  his mother were interred in a separate tomb Ahmed constructed in the Sehzade  Mosque in Constantinople. - BYJU&#x27;S, accessed September 30, 2025,  https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/ahmed-i/</li>
