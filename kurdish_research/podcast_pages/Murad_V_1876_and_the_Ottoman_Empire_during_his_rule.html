This personal tragedy occurred against the backdrop of the Great Eastern Crisis, which involved the empire&#x27;s full financial default in 1875, the atrocities of the April Uprising in Bulgaria, and the ensuing wars with Serbia and Montenegro. Ultimately, the Sultan was deposed due to alleged insanity, an outcome that directly paved the way for the autocratic rule of Abdulhamid II, while the attempt to implement the first Ottoman constitution was delayed by the chaotic summer.</p><a href="../docs/Murad V and Ottoman Empire Crisis.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ Murad V - Wikipedia, accessed November 20, 2025,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murad_V</li>
