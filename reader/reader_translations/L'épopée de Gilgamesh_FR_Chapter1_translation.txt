Chapter 1 An indomitable king

Gilgamesh was the most handsome of all the children of men. His father was named Lugalbanda.
His mother was the divine Ninsun, a beautiful and proud woman, who had the magical power to make wild buffaloes obey.
That is why she was nicknamed "the wild cow." With the milk she fed her son, she transmitted to him the strength of buffaloes.
Without this strength received from his mother, would he have had the courage to cross the mountains, to venture into regions the sun never illuminates, to cross the immense sea?
Yes, King Gilgamesh was well-born. Unparalleled power and beauty, that is what he had received as his birthright.
When he began to reign over Uruk-the-Enclosure, Gilgamesh did not know the limits of his strength.
He loved to walk proudly through the streets of the city. He was arrogant, insolent.
<< I

am the king, I act like the king,” he would affirm with a disdainful air. Who could have stood up to him?
His pride became so excessive that he began to impose a reign of terror on his city.
All the women, all the girls of the land, he thought, were his property.
As soon as he left his palace, the young girls were quickly warned so they could go back inside and hide with the women.
Even the men avoided him because he quickly became angry.
He had an escort to protect him, but he cared little about putting himself in danger.
He was so sure of his strength! And he handled weapons so well!
He always found a reason to start a fight: "You'll see who I am," he would threaten.
He would go on the attack and leave the one who had the misfortune of crossing his path half-dead.
poor fellow Then quietly, he would continue his walk. The inhabitants of Uruk gathered in secret. - What are we going to do?
they asked themselves. Lugalbanda's son is becoming unbearable. He harasses our women, he dishonors our daughters.
The strongest among us get beaten up. Are we not honest citizens of the city?
Do we not have the right to respect?

The best thing, proposed one of them, is to complain to the Great Gods.
Let's offer them tasty little dishes, let's send up to them the smoke of fatty meats.

the aroma, they will rejoice and will eventually listen to our complaints.
So offerings were made and the Great Gods eventually heard the complaint of the inhabitants.
They went to find Anu, the lord god of Uruk:

- Was it you who installed this wretched Gilgamesh in his city?
Do you know that he sows terror in his path? The inhabitants have built a beautiful temple for you and for your lady Ishtar.
them? Can you do nothing for Then, they went to find the goddess Aruru, whose job it was to create humans:

- Was it you who formed men?
Then obey Anu. He will ask you to create a man more terrible than a hurricane. He will confront Gilgamesh.
Thus the people of Uruk will have peace.

Aruru heard their advice and responded favorably to the request of the god Anu.
After dipping her hands in water, she took a large piece of clay and placed it in the steppe.
She worked the clay to shape a creature: the legs, the torso, the arms, the head came from her expert hands.
The clay creature began to live. Thus, in the solitude of the steppe, Enkidu the wild man was born.
13


The wild man

Enkidu had a hairy body, long hair that waved like ears of wheat under the caress of the wind.
And with that, robust and massive like the god of War!
Born in the desert spaces, he grew up without seeing a single human being. He was a wild child, a rough-hewn one.
The beasts were his company; he grazed with the gazelles, he went to drink at the pools with the wild animals.
From his mouth came inarticulate cries, like the bellowing of stags or the grunting of boars.
One day, a young hunter passed through the area. He knew the favorite spots of the herds¹, always set his traps in the right place, dug pits on the animals' paths and covered them with reeds.
That day, he came to check the traps he had set a few days before.
He had left his home when the sun had not yet risen and, now, he was walking without a sound on marshy ground.
He proceeded cautiously, probing the brown water with his spear and trying to find his bearings in the rare gaps of the fog that crept over the marsh.
He finally reached firmer ground, and saw a stretch of clear water.
He told himself that after

1. Herds: groups of wild beasts.

14


all, the traps could wait and he lay in wait, in case a herd of does and stags came to drink at sunrise.
He set down his spear, his bow and arrows, threw a few twigs in the air to check that the wind was favorable.
On these treeless lands, the hunter's art lay in his ability to remain perfectly still;
no bird with a piercing gaze, no shepherd moving his flock should spot the hunter hunched over, blended into the landscape like a clod of clay caressed by the wind.


The hunter waited, dreaming of the doe that could appear at any moment at the water's edge.
He thought about how to throw his spear so that it would split the air and hit the beast at the withers.
Then, quick as lightning, he would rush to slit its throat.

Tired of waiting, the hunter dozed off.
The sunrise shook him from his stupor. To his left, in the distance, he saw the first rays of the sun setting the walls of Uruk ablaze.
Around him, the sun began to chase away the fog. It was then that he noticed them.
Whole herds were there, silent, at the edge of the pool. He had not seen them approach.
Large, indolent stags were quenching their thirst in the company of roe deer and fallow deer;
a little apart,

16

wild donkeys, called onagers, mingled with a company of boars.
There were more animals there than any hunter, in a whole lifetime of tracking, would have dreamed of killing.
Stunned, the hunter fixed his gaze on the heads crowned with large antlers, on the majestic tusks of the boars, he was amazed at the size of these plump rumps, the barbaric spines.
And suddenly, his gaze was caught by a shape that had just emerged from the mist.
Dread darkened the hunter's gaze: this thing that came and went, breathed, imposed its presence in the midst of the great stags, the does and the fallow deer, this thing WAS NOT AN ANIMAL!
Then without even thinking of taking his bow and his spear, he fled towards Uruk.
Sitting cross-legged in front of the fire where meat was cooking, his father ate in silence.
- Father, articulated the young hunter, I saw the lullu.
The father raised vague eyes to his son, stopped chewing, belched.

- The lullu, insisted the son.
The wild man, if you will, the hulking brute, the rough-hewn one. I saw him as I see you.
The father spat out a piece of bone hidden in the meat, fixed his gaze on his son:

17


- The lullu does not live near men.
- I saw him as I see you. He was in the midst of the beasts that come at night to the great marsh.
I watched the herds, and in the middle, there was the lullu.

- A boar surely.
- A boar does not stand up on its hind legs.

- A roe deer.

- A roe deer does not laugh.
I really think I heard him laugh.

But the father refused to be persuaded.
The wrinkles on his forehead deepened: he searched his memory for the little he had been taught about the wild man.
The lullu lived in the time of the ancient day when, with a blow of a hoe¹, the sky and the earth were torn from each other.
The gods had made him crudely with clay. This was long before Lahar taught men to raise sheep and Ashan taught them to sow seeds 2. The lullu knew nothing of all this, how to sow, how to care for livestock, nor even how

to hunt. No, the lullu, knew none of that.
That is what the father, in broken words, drew from his memory and told his son.
But the son did not let himself be dissuaded:

- Precisely, father, he doesn't know all that.
He lives with the beasts, he is like them, he drinks water.
When I fled, I found my traps: they were all broken.
And the pits that I cover with reeds had been filled with earth. I'm sure it was him.
He is intelligent, he defends his animal friends. He doesn't want them to be harmed!
-

Then, said the father, finally convinced, this is what you must do. You will go and tell all this to King Gilgamesh.
I am certain he will listen to you. Tell him the whole story and then, do what he tells you.
The hunter presented himself at the palace and requested an audience.

- Here, he said to the king, is the adventure that happened to me.
He recounted his encounter with Enkidu, the wild man. He described his body, his muscles, his rough-hewn appearance.
Never had he seen such a terrifying creature.

- Doubtless, said the king, you confused him with a large boar.
19


- Excuse me, Majesty, but a boar does not walk on two legs.

-

Then with a wild goat.
Goats stand on their hind legs to nibble leaves and fruits.
- But goats have horns; he had none.
I tell you, it was a lullu that I saw.
A gigantic human, strong as a rock fallen from the sky, with muscles that roll under the skin, and a bull's neck!
That's what I saw! I fled, because I was afraid of being crushed by just one of his hands if he ever caught me!
There is not a stronger man in the world than him.
me

King Gilgamesh started as if he had just been insulted.
A strange spark lit up in his eyes:

- I order that he be brought here, to my city.
Have Beauty-Joy accompany you and go back there. She is the best of my courtesans, she will know how to handle it.
And when he is here, before me, we shall see what we shall see!

Beauty-Joy

The hunter set off again, accompanied by the courtesan.
They took three days to reach the pool, and approached with caution. There wasn't the slightest bit of game.
They settled in comfortably and began to wait. At the end of two days, they had still not seen the shadow of any game.
But on the third day, the hunter brushed Beauty-Joy's arm.
A herd had silently approached the pool: the animals stood there, wading gently in the water, relaxing their muscles after all their running in the steppe and drinking the clear water.
At first, the hunter did not see the lullu. He was seized with doubt: had he dreamed it the first time?
But the wild man was indeed there, in the middle of the herd.
He was leaning over the pool and lapping up the water like an animal.
He didn't even know how to join his two hands to make a cup to hold the water, as men do when they drink from a spring!
He lapped like a beast. Beauty-Joy was without reaction. She who was an expert in men had never seen such a creature.
Was it even a man, this rough-hewn brute, covered in hair, grunting and uttering cries from the depths of his throat, like a stag bellowing?
The hunter discreetly shook the courtesan: - Your turn to play, Beauty-Joy. Take off your clothes and show him your charms.
Lure him, go on.

But the courtesan could not stop marveling at the incredible scene: a wild man in the midst of beasts!
Her gaze was fixed on the

21


majestic heads of the great stags, on the snouts of the wild pigs, on the bumpy foreheads of the buffaloes with thick horns, on their chests and their bitumen-colored loins.
Beauty-Joy took it all in with a single glance: the does and elegant fallow deer created for running, the she-buffaloes with their pensive eyes, the onagers with their strangely striped skin.
It was as if the entire animal society had gathered at the watering hole.
For the first time in her life, she was discovering the hidden world of wild animals, which usually stay away from humans.
She trembled, fascinated and fearful at the same time, as if she were entering a sacred space.
And he, the lullu, walked without fear among these beasts.
He caressed the spine of a buffalo, gently patted the flank of a doe, he moved among these animals like a king among his people.
The hunter had to pinch Beauty-Joy's arm for her to finally snap out of her fascination.
She approached slowly, lay down on the grass and waited for the lullu to spot her.
Then she took off her clothes to offer him her charms.
The wild man was wary at first, then he was caught in the trap of her beauty and came to lie down beside her.
Beauty-Joy showered him with sweet caresses, and he, the rough-hewn one,

22

took great pleasure in it.
They kissed, they embraced, they cuddled. For six days and seven nights, they did not stop loving each other.
At the end of the seven nights, Enkidu wanted to leave with his animal friends, but they moved away from him.
He wanted to join them, but his legs no longer carried him.
The seven nights spent with Beauty-Joy had tired him so much that he no longer knew how to run as before.
So, he came back to sit beside the courtesan. She spoke to him and he was astonished to understand what she was saying in human language, he who until now had only known the language of beasts:

-

You are as handsome as a god, Enkidu.
You cannot spend your whole life running in the steppe with the wild beasts.
You do not know what you are missing by staying in these desert regions.
I come from Uruk, the city that you must have seen in the distance without ever daring to approach.
Solid ramparts protect it. There are gardens, trees in whose shade one rests.
Every day there is music, there are festivities.
The men are strong and the women are very gentle. There is a great temple called the Eanna.
That is where Anu, the god of the Sky, and his lady Ishtar live. I will take you there.
You can meet our king Gilgamesh. He has the vigor of a bull. No one can resist him.
23


Listening to Beauty-Joy, Enkidu thought.

- Let's go, he said suddenly. I will measure myself against your king.
We will see who is stronger: the man of the city or the man of the steppe.
Think carefully, Enkidu, or you will say foolish things. No one is obliged to do what is beyond their means.
In Uruk, all the men are forces of nature.
They fear neither the beasts nor the men of other cities.
But none of them would dare to measure themselves against Gilgamesh. He is quick as lightning, he strikes like thunder.
And nothing tires him. He feasts with his courtesans, but in the morning, there he is, ready for any challenge.
And if you dared to provoke him, you would still be beaten because of his intelligence.
He calculates everything, he foresees everything. He can also be arrogant and brutal.
Beware, Enkidu, this man is not entirely a man.
He is two-thirds god and only one-third man.
His father, Lugalbanda, was a demigod. And his mother is Ninsun-the-wild-cow.
But Enkidu insisted:

- I was nourished with the good milk of the beasts of the steppe, I run as fast as an onager and I know how to fight with lions.
I will face your king and I will win.

Beauty-Joy was suddenly afraid.
She foresaw the fight, she shuddered at the thought that these two giants would come to fight without either one winning and that they would end up killing each other.
-

– Listen, Enkidu my friend, resumed the courtesan, who told you that the king wishes you harm?
Why would he want to measure himself against you? He knows he is the strongest.
Perhaps he wants to make you his friend. It was he who sent me to find you, it was on his order that I offered you my charms.
Perhaps he is dreaming of you right now. Come my friend, let us set out. I am sure he is waiting for you.
The king's two dreams

Beauty-Joy gave one of her garments to Enkidu, then they set out.
When evening came, they stopped at a shepherds' hut.
They widened their eyes when they saw this hulking brute arrive, so massive that it looked like a moving mountain.
They said to one another: “This fellow looks like Gilgamesh, but rough-hewn.
To want to attack him would be like wanting to attack the ramparts of Uruk. Pure madness!”
They offered bread and beer to the wild man, who sniffed them with suspicion.
24

25


- Eat the bread and drink the beer, said Beauty-Joy.
This is how men are accustomed to feeding themselves while the beasts drink water from the pools.
Enkidu ate the bread and had seven more helpings of beer. His heart was filled with cheerfulness.
He washed his body, then he perfumed himself with good oil.
Now he looked like a real man. He was as handsome as a bridegroom.
When night came, he told the shepherds to sleep peacefully while he would watch over the flocks.
He grabbed a club and went out of the hut. While the shepherds slept, lurking in the shadows, he watched for the wolves and lions that dared to approach the flocks and slaughtered them without mercy.
The next day, he resumed his journey with Beauty-Joy.

While Enkidu was walking towards Uruk, King Gilgamesh had two dreams.
In the first, he was surrounded by the stars of the sky and he saw a meteorite fall beside him.
He wanted to lift it, but it was too heavy. The people of Uruk came to caress the block of metal fallen from the sky, they cherished it as one does a toddler, and Gilgamesh took care of it as he would a wife.
He finally managed to lift it and placed it at the feet of his mother, Ninsun, who took great care of it in turn, as if it were her son.
He told the dream to his mother who said to him:

- My son, here is the interpretation of the dream that the gods have sent you: the stars represent the escort of strong men who are at your service.
The block of celestial stone that fell so heavily beside you, that you could not lift at first and that you caressed, this block that you then managed to bring to me and that I cherished as my son, is a friend that the gods have decided to send you.
He will be like another self to you, always there to serve you.
If in your dream you caressed it like a wife, it means that he will always be there by your side, ready to serve you.
The gods could not have sent you a more beautiful dream, my son. It is favorable to you.
In the second dream, Gilgamesh saw an axe lying in the middle of a square.
The crowd pressed in to admire it while Gilgamesh was full of attentions towards it, as if it were a wife.
Then he placed it at the feet of his mother Ninsun who took great care of it.
Ninsun said to him:

– Here is the interpretation of this second dream.
The axe represents the very strong friend that the gods will send you.
Stronger than a meteorite, he will be there by your side to defend and assist you.
Yes, the

27


gods are with you, my son. They have just sent you two favorable dreams.
Gilgamesh answered his mother:

- If a true friend is given to me, then I will know no greater joy in all my existence.
May these two dreams come true!
