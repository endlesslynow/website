The text first details Ibrahim&#x27;s psychological damage, which was inflicted by his two decades of isolation in the Kafes (the cage) and led to paranoia and violent personal excess once he took the throne. Crucially, the analysis then shifts to the state-level crisis, showing how Ibrahim&#x27;s incompetence fueled severe fiscal collapse, administrative chaos marked by the rapid turnover of Grand Viziers, and the drain of the costly and ill-advised Cretan War. Ultimately, his misrule led to his regicide by a unified coalition of the military (Janissaries), the religious establishment (ulema), and his own mother, though the resulting chaos inadvertently paved the way for the later, more stable Köprülü era.</p><a href="../docs/Sultan Ibrahim&#x27;s Reign and Empire.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ 1648: Sultan Ibrahim the Mad | Executed Today, accessed October 14, 2025,  https://www.executedtoday.com/2018/08/18/1648-sultan-ibrahim-the-mad/</li>
