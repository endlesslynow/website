The source begins by analyzing Selim II&#x27;s character, noting his reputation as &quot;Selim the Drunkard&quot; and his retreat from military command, contrasting this personal history with his role as a patron who commissioned Mimar Sinan&#x27;s architectural masterpiece, the Selimiye Mosque. Crucially, the text emphasizes that the empire’s institutional strength remained immense, demonstrated by the Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha&#x27;s effective administration, the successful conquest of Cyprus, and the astonishingly rapid rebuilding of the fleet following the catastrophic naval defeat at Lepanto in 1571. Ultimately, the analysis concludes that Selim&#x27;s rule marked a shift from the traditional warrior-sultan to a more bureaucratic, palace-centric form of governance in a mature empire that, despite emerging financial and military challenges like the disaster at Astrakhan, was operating at its classical zenith.</p><a href="../docs/Selim II and Ottoman Empire.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ Ottoman Sultan Selim II - Steemit, accessed September 30, 2025,  https://steemit.com/trending/@hemelmub/ottoman-sultan-selim-ii</li>
