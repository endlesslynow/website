It highlights how Bayezid dramatically centralized the Ottoman state, expanding its territory across both the Balkans and Anatolia through aggressive military campaigns, including a pivotal victory against European crusaders at Nicopolis. The text also describes his significant administrative reforms, such as the professionalization of the Janissary corps and the expansion of the devşirme system, which laid the groundwork for future Ottoman imperial power. However, his ambition and strategic overreach led to a catastrophic confrontation with Timur at the Battle of Ankara in 1402, resulting in Bayezid&#x27;s capture and the subsequent fragmentation of his empire into a devastating civil war known as the Ottoman Interregnum. Ultimately, the report posits that Bayezid was both the architect of the first centralized Ottoman state and the catalyst for its near-destruction, with his downfall providing crucial lessons for the dynasty&#x27;s future.</p><a href="../docs/Bayezid I and Ottoman Empire.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ Bayezid I | PDF | Ottoman Empire - Scribd, accessed September 17, 2025,  https://www.scribd.com/document/702939352/Bayezid-I</li>
