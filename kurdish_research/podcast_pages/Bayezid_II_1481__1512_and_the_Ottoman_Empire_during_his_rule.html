It details Bayezid&#x27;s early life and rise to power, including the dynastic struggle with his brother Cem, which significantly influenced his foreign policy. The text explores his character as a pious and just ruler, highlighting his extensive patronage of culture and architecture and his strategic decision to welcome Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain, benefiting the empire economically and intellectually. Furthermore, it examines key military and administrative actions, such as the successful war against Venice that established Ottoman naval supremacy and the challenges posed by the emerging Safavid dynasty and the Şahkulu rebellion, which ultimately led to his forced abdication by his son Selim I.</p><a href="../docs/Bayezid II and Ottoman Empire Research.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ Complex of Sultan Bayezid II Health Museum | Republic of Türkiye Trakya  University, accessed September 18, 2025,  https://saglikmuzesi-en.trakya.edu.tr/pages/sultan-bayezid-ii/?preview=true</li>
