It begins by clarifying the term &quot;Scythian&quot; itself, differentiating between its narrow and broad applications, and then explores their eastern origins in Southern Siberia, supported by discoveries like the Arzhan kurgans. The text highlights their complex genetic ancestry as a blend of West and East Eurasian populations, alongside their varied social structures that included both mobile elites and settled agriculturalists, challenging the monolithic &quot;nomad&quot; stereotype. Furthermore, the source details the Scythian economy, driven by pastoralism, trade with Greek colonies, and strategic raiding, and underscores their military dominance through advanced mounted archery tactics and the composite bow, which famously thwarted Darius I. Finally, it explores their distinctive &quot;Animal Style&quot; art, elaborate burial rituals (including human and horse sacrifice), and the profound impact of their interactions with major &quot;civilized&quot; empires, concluding with their eventual decline and lasting genetic legacy.</p><a href="../docs/Deep Research_ The Scythians.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ The Genetic Origins of the Scythians, the Mysterious Nomadic Warriors of the  Eurasian Steppes, Deciphered - La Brújula Verde, accessed September 17, 2025,  https://www.labrujulaverde.com/en/2025/07/the-genetic-origins-of-the-scythians -the-mysterious-nomadic-warriors-of-the-eurasian-steppes-deciphered/</li>
