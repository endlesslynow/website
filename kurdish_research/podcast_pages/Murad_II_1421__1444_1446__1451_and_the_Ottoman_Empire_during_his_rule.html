It details the challenges he faced in securing his throne, including internal rebellions and external threats from European coalitions, and explains how his military victories, particularly at Varna and Kosovo, cemented Ottoman dominance. The text further emphasizes Murad II&#x27;s institutional reforms, most notably the formalization of the devşirme system and the rise of the Janissaries, which centralized power and created a loyal elite. Additionally, it discusses his architectural patronage and the economic recovery during his rule, portraying him as a &quot;Reluctant Architect&quot; who, despite personal desires for peace, laid the essential groundwork for the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s future imperial expansion.</p><a href="../docs/Murad II and Ottoman Empire Research.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ Sultan Murad II: The MOST FEARSOME Ruler of Ottoman Empire - YouTube,  accessed September 18, 2025, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHEjEouoV3o</li>
