    <p>I've been to Iraqi-Kurdistan twice, once in 2016 and again in 2022. Both times I had plans to visit Zakho. Both times I got as far as Dohuk, and turned back. Zakho is not a city one can just go to. You have to plan thoroughly to go to Zakho. You have to research the political situation for months ahead of time, make backup plans, make escape plans, carefully monitor the situation the night before you leave, the morning before you leave, five minutes before you step into the taxi, and one minute before you step into the taxi. Most importantly, before travelling to Zakho, you have to decide if you're feeling lucky.</p><br>
    
    <p>In 2016 I abandoned my plans to visit Zakho because a coup happened in Turkey the night I arrived in Dohuk. Now going to a city sandwiched between ISIS and a border lined with an extremely anxious Turkish military seemed like a bad idea. On my 2022 visit, I wasn't feeling lucky. Soon after, the road to the Zakho was unexpectedly bombed by Turkey. 20 civilians were killed.</p>
    
    <p>Zakho itself is not a dangerous city. Like all cities in Iraqi-Kurdistan, you will be safer there than any western-European city. The danger lies in getting there, its remoteness, and its violent neighbors.</p><br>
    
    <p>Paradoxically, Zakho is a thriving city because of these very same factors. For example, for geographical and political reasons, ISIS could never dream of reaching Zakho, despite their ability to seize over a hundred thousand square kilometres, and despite its capital city, Mosul, being just 50 kilometres away. However, because of ISIS, hundreds of thousands of people from all over Syria and Iraq fled their homes and moved to the safety of Zakho's remoteness.</p><br>
    
    <p>On the borders of Syria, Iraq, and Iraqi-Kurdistan; and having the protection of the American-backed Kurdish military, Zakho's remoteness has allowed it to become a safe-haven for Syrian refugees fleeing the civil war, Yazidi refugees who either fled or survived their 74th genocide in nearby Sinjar, other Iraqi peoples escaping either ISIS or the endless poverty and turmoil in Iraq, and wealthy Turkish businessmen who flock to Zakho like prospectors in a gold rush. Here in the Middle East, safety is gold. With safety comes business, and with business, comes a future - something most people in the Middle East are desperate to obtain.</p><br>
    
    <p>This is present-day Zakho. I believe it shares a lot of similarities with the Zakho of 1950. It's still peaceful, it's certainly multi-cultural, and it's still a remote border city with probably more smugglers than police. However, besides its new massive size and modernity, there is one outlying difference. The Jews of Zakho are gone forever.</p><br>
    
    <p>Ariel Sabar's "My Father's Paradise" recalls the last days of a Zakho as its "good old days" dried up and the ultra-violent modern Middle East was born. Sabar paints a picture of a Zakho that's poor, but peaceful. The kind of place where Jews and Muslims couldn't dream of harming one another. However, I have my doubts.</p><br>
    
    <p>This is a common narrative people in the Middle East tend to promote. "Before the colonizers, everything worked. We were peaceful." They say. Or if they're feeling particularly brave, "Before the modern governments, everything worked." I was also taught this in my American university.</p><br>
    
    <p>Later, as I studied further, and as shown in this data, I learned that the Middle East was never a peaceful place. The past, just as Sabar's father discovered about life in Israel, and again about life in America, is not a perfect place. But that doesn't stop us from trying to make it one.</p>

            <h2>I. Introduction: Zakho in the Mid-19th to Mid-20th Century – A Demographic Crossroads</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">Zakho's strategic importance as a border town and commercial hub set the stage for its diverse population. It highlights the multi-ethnic and multi-religious tapestry of Kurds, Jews, Christians, and Yezidis, and outlines the scope of the demographic analysis for the turbulent period of 1850-1950.</p>
            
            <h3>A. Zakho's Strategic and Historical Significance</h3>
            <p>The town of Zakho, situated in present-day Iraqi Kurdistan, was strategically vital from 1850 to 1950 due to its location near Turkish and Syrian borders, making it a key nexus for Greater Kurdistan. Historically a significant trading center for commodities like gallnuts, rice, and fruits, its economic dynamism attracted diverse peoples. Ancient roots, possibly linked to the Assyrian period and Hasaniyeh, and its mention in Islamic history underscore a long, varied past, predisposing it to complex settlement patterns.</p>

            <h3>B. The Multi-Ethnic and Multi-Religious Tapestry</h3>
            <div class="community-highlight">
                <p><strong>A Crossroads of Cultures:</strong> Zakho was characterized by a rich mosaic of Kurds, a significant Jewish population, various Christian denominations (Chaldean Catholics, Armenians, Syriac Christians, Nestorians/Assyrians), and Yezidis in the broader district.</p>
            </div>
            <p>This diversity, typical of Historic Kurdistan, was dynamic, shaped by migrations, economic shifts, and political pressures. Ancient settlements, trade, imperial expansions (Ottoman), and refugee influxes (e.g., Armenians) all contributed to this demographic complexity, amplified by Zakho's borderland status.</p>

            <h3>C. Scope and Methodology of the Demographic Analysis</h3>
            <p>This analysis covers the ethnic and religious demographics of Zakho town and district from 1850-1950, a period of transformation from late Ottoman rule to the nascent Iraqi state. It focuses on principal groups, their populations, communal structures, inter-group relations, and the impact of historical events. Reconstructing these demographics is challenging due to variable sources (travelers' accounts, missionary reports, Ottoman records, early Iraqi censuses), each with biases. A nuanced understanding of the "Muslim" category is crucial, often implying Kurds but also potentially including "Turks" (likely officials) and regional Arabs.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="demographic-landscape" class="content-section fade-in">
            <h2>II. The Demographic Landscape of Zakho: An Overview (1850-1950)</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">The complexities of reconstructing Zakho's historical demographics, discussing source variability and the challenge of distinguishing between town and district figures. It provides general population trends and estimates, highlighting significant fluctuations and the impact of events like famines and migrations. The transition from Ottoman to Iraqi administration and its effect on census-taking is also explored.</p>

            <h3>A. Challenges in Reconstructing Historical Demographics</h3>
            <p>Reconstructing Zakho's precise 1850-1950 demographics is complex due to source limitations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Source Variability:</strong> Data from travelers (often anecdotal, e.g., Campanile's ~10,000 population pre-1850), Ottoman censuses (e.g., 1881/82-1893, often undercounting, male-focused, giving 543 Jewish males for Zaku Kaza), and early Iraqi records (e.g., 1930 census: 26,835 for Zakho district) vary in methodology and bias.</li>
                <li><strong>Town vs. Kaza/District:</strong> Sources often ambiguously refer to Zakho town or the wider Kaza. For example, the 1930 census figure of 26,835 likely refers to the district, while a 1929 estimate of 4,000 likely refers to the town.</li>
                <li><strong>Defining Categories:</strong> Terminology for ethnic/religious groups can be inconsistent. "Turks" in early accounts likely meant Ottoman officials, not a large settled Turkoman group. "Christians" often grouped distinct denominations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>B. General Population Trends and Estimates for Zakho Town and Kaza</h3>
            <div class="chart-container">
                <canvas id="zakhoTotalPopulationChart"></canvas>
            </div>
            <p class="text-center text-gray-600 mb-6 italic">Selected population estimates for Zakho Town. Data points are indicative due to source variability.</p>
            
            <p>Key population estimates and trends:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mid-19th Century (Town):</strong> Campanile (pre-1850) estimated ~10,000. Jewish sources suggest Jews were half to two-thirds; an 1851 account states Jews occupied 100 of 150 houses.</li>
                <li><strong>Late 19th Century (Kaza):</strong> Ottoman census (1881/82-1893) recorded 543 Jewish males in Zaku Kaza, suggesting a total Jewish Kaza population of ~2,172-2,715.</li>
                <li><strong>Early 20th Century (Town, pre-WWI):</strong> Jewish population estimated at 2,400 in 1906.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-WWI & Mandate Period:</strong> Zakho town reported as 4,000 in 1929. Zakho Kaza (district) recorded 26,835 in 1930 Iraqi census.</li>
                <li><strong>Mid-20th Century (Town, up to 1950):</strong> Population reached ~30,000 by 1950, a rapid increase from ~4,000 in 1929, suggesting significant in-migration, likely of Kurds, a trend that accelerated post-1950.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Variations in figures reflect data collection difficulties and genuine demographic volatility due to migration, crises (e.g., 1880 famine), and administrative changes. The shift to Iraqi administration brought more systematic but politically influenced censuses.</p>
            
            <h3>C. Comparative Population Data Summary</h3>
            <p>The report includes detailed tables (Table 1: Comparative Estimates, Table 2: Ottoman/Iraqi Census Data) summarizing available figures. These tables highlight the numerical presence of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim communities over time, noting the challenges in consistent categorization and scope (town vs. district). For instance, Campanile's early 1800s estimate for the town was ~10,000 (6,000 Jews, 1,000 Christians, 3,000 "Turks"). The 1922-24 Mosul Vilayet enumeration showed Kurds as 64.9%, Jews 1.5%, Christians 7.7%, Yezidis 3.3%, Turks/Turkomans 4.8%, and Arabs 20.8% of the wider Vilayet.</p>

            <p>Key population points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1827:</strong> ~600 Jewish families (Rabbi David D'Beth Hillel).</li>
                <li><strong>1848:</strong> 200-300 families (Benjamin II/Zaken).</li>
                <li><strong>1851:</strong> Occupied 100 of 150 houses in town (Stern).</li>
                <li><strong>1880:</strong> Half of 400-500 houses owned by Jews; famine year.</li>
                <li><strong>1881/82-93:</strong> 543 Jewish males in Kaza (Ottoman Census).</li>
                <li><strong>1906:</strong> Peak estimate of 2,400 individuals in town.</li>
                <li><strong>1930:</strong> 1,471 Aramaic-speaking Jews (Iraqi Census).</li>
                <li><strong>1947:</strong> 1,394 individuals (Iraqi Census).</li>
                <li><strong>1950-51:</strong> ~1,800-1,900 individuals (350 families) on eve of mass exodus.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="community-highlight">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> An anomalous figure of 15,000 Jews in "Zakho city" in 1945 is likely an outlier or refers to a wider region. Most sources suggest 1,500-2,500 for the town in the first half of the 20th century.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>B. Religious and Communal Life</h3>
            <div class="community-highlight">
                <p><strong>"Jerusalem of Kurdistan":</strong> Zakho was a major spiritual center, training rabbis, mohalim, and shoḥaṭim for Kurdish Jewry.</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Synagogues:</strong> Two main ones: Knishta Rabta (Great Synagogue, est. or renovated 1798, capacity ~3,000) and Knishta Zurta (Small Synagogue, with study hall and school, capacity ~1,000, destroyed in 1891 attack).</li>
                <li><strong>Language:</strong> Spoke a Jewish Neo-Aramaic dialect and Kurmanji Kurdish.</li>
                <li><strong>Residential Area:</strong> Lived in a Jewish quarter (*maḥallət huzaye*).</li>
                <li><strong>Culture:</strong> Preserved ancient customs, rich oral traditions. Notably, Jews of Zakho bore arms, similar to Kurdish Muslims.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>C. Socio-Economic Role</h3>
            <p>The Jewish community was vital to Zakho's economy, engaged in commerce, crafts (weaving, goldsmithing, jewelry, shoemaking), cattle raising, logging, and agriculture. Some achieved considerable wealth. Their trade involvement significantly contributed to Zakho's status as a commercial hub.</p>

            <h3>D. Periods of Insecurity and Persecution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1880:</strong> Severe famine, many deaths.</li>
                <li><strong>1891:</strong> Attack, Knishta Zurta burned.</li>
                <li><strong>1892:</strong> Troubles intensified, Tigris flood destroyed homes and synagogues.</li>
                <li><strong>1920s-1930s:</strong> Deteriorating security and economic status led to emigration.</li>
                <li><strong>1941 (Farhud):</strong> Though not directly in Zakho, the Baghdad pogrom created widespread fear among Iraqi Jews, accelerating emigration sentiment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>E. Emigration to Palestine/Israel</h3>
            <p>Emigration was a gradual process culminating in a mass exodus:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mid-19th Century:</strong> Initial movements due to economic decline (Suez Canal impact) and religious motivations.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-WWI (1920s-1930s):</strong> Intensified due to war consequences, British Mandate, deteriorating security, and economic decline. Zakho served as a clandestine crossing point. Between 1912-1942, ~285 families immigrated.</li>
                <li><strong>1950-1952 (Mass Exodus):</strong> Following Israel's establishment (1948) and hostile Iraqi policies (property confiscation), almost the entire remaining community (over 1,800 people) left for Israel, ending millennia of presence. First group of 70 families left Oct 1950.</li>

                <li><strong>Churches:</strong> Mar Gorgis (St. George) Cathedral (built 1911), Mariam al Adra (Abassia), Sacred Heart (Bidar).</li>
                <li><strong>Population:</strong> 50 Chaldeans in Zakho town in 1914. Campanile (early 19th C) included them in his 1,000 "Catholics & Jacobites."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>B. Syriac Catholics</h3>
            <p>Maintained a presence. Mariam Al Adra Church (Nassara quarter, attested 1850) originally Syriac Orthodox, transitioned to Syriac Catholicism, influenced by Catholic missions (e.g., Léopold Soldini, d.1779 in Zakho). Campanile's 1,000 Christians included "Catholic and Jacobite."</p>

            <h3>C. Armenians</h3>
            <div class="community-highlight">
                <p><strong>Refuge and Rebuilding:</strong> Community largely formed post-Armenian Genocide (1915). Refugees fled persecution near Turkey-Iraq border.</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Sheltered by Kurdish notable Mohammed Beg Shemdin Agha, who provided land for a church.</li>
                <li><strong>Church:</strong> First Armenian church formally established in 1923. Some references to an older church being rebuilt.</li>
                <li><strong>Population:</strong> Grew significantly after 1915. Post-1950 data indicates 1,500 during Iran-Iraq war; contemporary estimates suggest ~1,000 with historical roots.</li>
                <li><strong>Economy:</strong> Contributed as sheepherders, farmers, craftsmen (traditional Kurdish clothing *Shal u Shepk*).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>D. Nestorians/Assyrians (Church of the East)</h3>
            <p>Historical presence in the broader region. Devastated by the Seyfo (Assyrian Genocide, 1915-1918).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Presence:</strong> Mark Sykes (c.1908) noted Nestorians in Hakkiari, Amadia, and Zakho.</li>
                <li><strong>Conversions:</strong> From 17th/18th C, many converted to Chaldean Catholicism due to missionary efforts, reducing Nestorian numbers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>E. Overall Christian Population and Inter-Community Dynamics</h3>
            <p>Early 19th C (Campanile): 1,000 Christians (Catholic & Jacobite) of ~10,000 total. Brill Reference: 1,000 Christians in 1800 and again in 1923 (with 2,000 Jews, 1,000 Muslims).</p>
            <p>Christians generally resided in the "Nassara" quarter and spoke Neo-Aramaic dialects.</p>
            <p>Late 19th/early 20th C was a period of crisis: raids by some Kurdish tribes, and the Genocides (Seyfo, Armenian) led to a "collapse of community and denominational unity." Despite hardships, communities showed resilience, rebuilding churches. The arrival of Armenians added a new dimension. Establishment of separate ecclesiastical structures (Chaldean, Armenian) showed vitality and formalization of identities.</p>

            <h2>V. The Muslim Populace: Kurds, "Turks," and Arabs</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">The Muslim population, predominantly Kurdish, constituted the majority in Zakho and its region. The Kurds as the dominant ethnic group, the interpretation of historical mentions of "Turks" (likely Ottoman officials), and the limited Arab presence within Zakho town during the 1850-1950 period.</p>

            <h3>A. Kurds: The Dominant Ethnic Group</h3>
            <div class="community-highlight">
                <p><strong>Regional Dominance:</strong> Kurds were the principal ethnic group, largely Sunni Muslims organized along tribal lines, speaking Kurdish.</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Leadership:</strong> The Shamdin Agha family (Slivani tribe) was prominent, reportedly "ruled all the Muslims, Jews and Christians of Zakho and its surroundings" from the late 19th century. Hazim Beg, a powerful figure from this family, served in Iraqi parliament/senate. This leadership mediated relations within the Ottoman/Iraqi state framework.</li>
                <li><strong>Regional Majority:</strong> British intelligence (early 20th C) and the 1922-24 Iraqi enumeration (64.9% of Mosul Vilayet) confirmed Kurdish predominance.</li>
                <li><strong>Urban Consolidation:</strong> Zakho's population growth to ~30,000 by 1950 was largely due to Kurdish influx from rural areas, a trend starting in the early 20th century due to instability and economic factors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>B. The "Turks" of Zakho: Interpretation of Historical Mentions</h3>
            <p>Campanile (early 19th C) mentioned "three thousand Turks." This term in 19th C Ottoman Kurdistan likely referred to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ottoman officials, military personnel, or state functionaries (most probable).</li>
                <li>Turkish-speaking Muslims, not necessarily a large settled ethnic Turkoman group (Turkomans were 4.8% in Mosul Vilayet, concentrated elsewhere like Kirkuk).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The withdrawal of Ottoman forces in Nov 1918 ended this official Turkish presence. Consistent references to a large, permanent Turkoman community *in Zakho town* are lacking.</p>

            <h3>C. Arab Presence</h3>
            <p>The 1922-24 Iraqi enumeration showed Arabs as 20.8% of Mosul Vilayet. While Zakho town was predominantly Kurdish, its proximity to Arab regions (Syria/Iraq) and trade role implied some Arab presence (transient traders, intermarriage, small settlements in the district). Specific demographic data for a settled Arab community *within Zakho town* (1850-1950) is sparse. Faysh Khabur (Zakho District) had Arabs settled much later (post-1950); earlier it was Assyrian/Chaldean.</p>

            <h2>VI. The Yezidi Community: Presence in the Zakho Environs</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">The Yezidi religious minority, historically present in northern Iraq, including the Zakho district. However, their demographic footprint within Zakho town itself appears less prominent compared to their presence in surrounding rural areas and traditional heartlands like Sinjar and Sheikhan.</p>

            <h3>A. Demographic Presence and Location</h3>
            <div class="community-highlight">
                <p><strong>Traditional Heartlands:</strong> Yezidis are concentrated in Sinjar and Sheikhan, with their main shrine at Lalish. The Zakho district is also an area of Yezidi habitation.</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regional Presence:</strong> Evliya Çelebi (17th C) mentioned Yezidis in nearby regions (Amedi, Cizre, Duhok).</li>
                <li><strong>Mosul Vilayet Data:</strong> The 1922-24 Iraqi enumeration listed 26,257 Yezidis (3.3% of Vilayet). General Iraqi Yezidi population (1920-1947) was 26,000-30,000.</li>
                <li><strong>Zakho Town:</strong> Specific figures for a significant, settled Yezidi community *within Zakho town* (1850-1950) are scarce. They likely interacted with Zakho as a market/administrative center but primarily resided rurally.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>B. Social and Political Context</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Society:</strong> Traditionally tribal, some formed confederations with Muslim/Christian tribes. Predominantly Kurmanji-speaking; identity debated (Kurds vs. distinct Yezidi ethno-religious group).</li>
                <li><strong>19th Century Persecution:</strong> Endured devastating assaults from Ottoman troops and some Sunni Kurdish tribes (e.g., 1832 massacre by Mir Mohammed of Rawanduz). This likely led to displacement and isolation in defensible areas, possibly limiting urban presence.</li>
                <li><strong>State Resistance:</strong> Resisted Ottoman and later Iraqi conscription attempts, leading to uprisings (e.g., 1935-1940), reflecting a desire for autonomy.</li>

                        <li><strong>Local Governance:</strong> Kurdish leadership (e.g., Shamdin Agha family) "ruled all communities," implying a hierarchical system. Hazim Beg showed respect to Jewish leaders.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shared Security:</strong> Jews of Zakho bore arms, like Kurdish Muslims, suggesting integration or shared security needs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protection/Solidarity:</strong> Mohammed Beg Shemdin Agha sheltered Armenian refugees (1915). Local Muslims sometimes defended Jewish neighbors.</li>

            <h3>C. Role of Local Leadership and Ottoman/State Policies</h3>
            <p>Broader political contexts heavily influenced dynamics. Ottoman Tanzimat reforms (mid-19th C) aimed to centralize control, disrupting local autonomies. The Hamidiye regiments (late 19th C), composed of Kurdish tribes armed by the state, often abused power against Armenians and others, exacerbating tensions. The Ottoman collapse, rise of nationalisms (Turkish, Arab), British Mandate, and Iraqi state formation introduced new frameworks impacting minorities. These larger currents often overwhelmed local coexistence, leading to significant demographic shifts.</p>

            <h2>IX. Conclusion: The Shifting Sands of Zakho's Demography (1850-1950)</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">The major demographic transformations in Zakho over the century, highlighting the exodus of the Jewish community, the resilience of Christian groups, and the consolidation of the Kurdish Muslim majority. It reflects on the enduring legacy of Zakho's diverse past and the challenges in reconstructing its complex demographic history.</p>

            <h3>A. Recapitulation of Major Demographic Transformations</h3>
            <p>The century 1850-1950 saw profound demographic shifts in Zakho:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Jewish Exodus:</strong> Near-total departure of the ancient Jewish community by 1951-52, erasing a key part of Zakho's identity ("Jerusalem of Kurdistan").</li>
                <li><strong>Christian Resilience:</strong> Chaldeans, Syriacs, Nestorians/Assyrians, and later Armenians persisted despite severe persecution (Seyfo, Armenian Genocide). Armenian refugees added a new element.</li>
                <li><strong>Muslim Consolidation:</strong> Predominantly Kurdish Muslim population solidified its majority. Local Kurdish Aghas (e.g., Shamdin Agha family) were influential. Late-period population growth driven by Kurdish influx. "Turks" (likely Ottoman officials) waned; settled Arab presence in town was small. Yezidis were in the district, not a major town component.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="community-highlight">
                <p><strong>Key Transformation:</strong> By 1950, Zakho was becoming more ethnically/religiously homogeneous (primarily Kurdish Muslim) due to forced displacement, persecution, and politically driven demographic engineering affecting non-Muslim minorities.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>B. The Enduring Legacy of a Diverse Past</h3>
            <p>Despite these changes and losses, the memory of Zakho's multi-ethnic and multi-religious past endures, informing its cultural landscape. The 1850-1950 period was pivotal, shaping Zakho's later demographic profile, which, while Kurdish-predominant, still bears imprints of its diverse heritage.</p>

            <h3>C. Final Reflections on Data and Interpretation</h3>
            <p>Reconstructing Zakho's historical demography is challenging due to varied and sometimes contradictory sources (travelers' accounts, censuses, community records). A critical approach is essential.</p>
            <p>Zakho's demographic story illustrates how local Middle Eastern communities were affected by declining empires, rising colonialism, exclusionary nationalisms, and regional conflicts. Its fate was tied to these larger currents, underscoring the vulnerability of diverse societies to powerful external forces that could override local coexistence and lead to irreversible change.</p>
