It chronicles Mehmed&#x27;s strategic ascent to power, highlighting his military victories and diplomatic acumen in reuniting the fractured state. The sources then examine his policies of consolidation, including the crucial implementation of the devşirme system and his significant patronage of public works like the Yeşil Külliye in Bursa, which served to legitimize his rule. Finally, the text explores the internal and external challenges Mehmed faced, such as the Bedreddin rebellion and the &quot;Düzmece&quot; Mustafa affair, alongside his pragmatic foreign policy, ultimately cementing his legacy as the &quot;second founder&quot; of the Ottoman Empire.</p><a href="../docs/Mehmed_I_1413__1421.pdf" download>Download PDF</a><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li>​ Al-Lārī, M.

Mighty sovereigns of the Ottoman throne: Sultan Mehmed I. 23#  The Restorer: Sultan Mehmed I and the Reforging of the Ottoman Empire (1413-1421)    Introduction: From the Ashes of Ankara    On the eve of the 15th century, the Ottoman state, under the energetic and aggressive  leadership of Sultan Bayezid I, had reached a zenith of power. Through a series of rapid  campaigns, Bayezid had forged a centralized empire stretching from the Danube to the  Euphrates, annexing Turkish principalities (beyliks) in Anatolia and crushing a Crusader army  in the Balkans.1 This expansion, however, brought the Ottomans into direct conflict with  another formidable power: the Central Asian conqueror Timur (Tamerlane). The collision of  these two expansionist forces culminated in the Battle of Ankara on July 28, 1402, a  cataclysmic event that shattered the Ottoman state.3 The Ottoman army was annihilated, and  Sultan Bayezid himself was captured, dying in captivity the following year.3  The defeat at Ankara precipitated the immediate decentralization and collapse of the  centralized Ottoman state, ushering in an eleven-year period of dynastic warfare known as the  Fetret Devri, or the Interregnum (1402-1413).3 This was not merely a pause in dynastic rule but  a bloody and socially divisive chapter of Ottoman history in its own right, a period of such  profound crisis that it brought the empire to the brink of total dissolution.5 Timur deliberately  engineered this collapse by dismembering the empire, restoring the lands of the annexed  Anatolian beyliks to their former rulers and dividing the remaining Ottoman territory among  four of Bayezid&#x27;s surviving sons: Süleyman, İsa, Mûsa, and Mehmed.4 This act ignited a  fratricidal war for the throne that would consume the Ottoman realm for over a decade.  From this crucible of chaos, one prince, Mehmed Çelebi, would emerge victorious. Sultan  Mehmed I, through a masterful combination of patient military strategy, astute diplomacy that  leveraged the self-interest of his rivals&#x27; allies, and a sophisticated program of political  legitimation, successfully navigated the turmoil of the Interregnum to reunite the Ottoman  state. His reign (1413-1421), though brief, was not merely a restoration of the pre-1402 status  quo but a fundamental reforging of the Ottoman polity. He established a more resilient  foundation that enabled the imperial expansion of his successors, earning him the enduring  historical title of the &quot;second founder&quot; (ikinci kurucu) of the Ottoman Empire.11    Part I: The Crucible of Civil War: The Ascent of  Mehmed Çelebi (1402-1413)    The Ottoman Interregnum was a period of extreme political complexity, involving multiple  internal factions, foreign powers, and a constantly shifting map of alliances and territorial  control.5 The path to reunification was a grueling, eleven-year struggle that tested the military  and political acumen of all four of Bayezid&#x27;s sons.    The Post-Ankara Political Landscape (1402-1403)    In the immediate aftermath of the Battle of Ankara, Timur systematically dismantled Bayezid&#x27;s  Anatolian empire, restoring the beyliks of Karaman, Aydın, Menteşe, Germiyan, and Saruhan to  their former ruling families.2 This action erased decades of Ottoman conquest in Anatolia and  confined the dynastic struggle to the core Ottoman lands. The sons of Bayezid scrambled to  secure what territory they could:  ●​ Süleyman Çelebi, the eldest, fled the battlefield with the Grand Vizier Çandarlı Ali  Pasha and the state treasury, establishing himself in the European province of Rumeli  with his capital at Edirne.4  ●​ İsa Çelebi asserted control over the old capital of Bursa and the surrounding region in  western Anatolia.4  ●​ Mehmed Çelebi, the youngest of the main contenders, was saved from the battlefield  by his tutor and future Grand Vizier, Bayezid Pasha, and retreated to his provincial  governorship in Amasya, where he established a secure but isolated power base.4  Süleyman, fearing a potential invasion from Timur and needing to secure his rear against his  brothers, immediately entered into negotiations with the Christian powers. In the resulting  Treaty of Gallipoli (February 1403), he made significant concessions to the Byzantine Emperor  Manuel II Palaiologos, Venice, and Genoa. He ceded strategic territories, including the vital  port of Thessaloniki and coastal lands on the Marmara and Black Seas, and, most  humiliatingly, released the Emperor from his obligation to pay tribute.2 This treaty underscored  the desperate weakness of the Ottoman position and the degree to which foreign powers  could now intervene in dynastic politics.    The Anatolian Struggle: Mehmed vs. İsa (1403-1406)    While Süleyman consolidated his rule in Europe, the primary conflict played out in Anatolia  between Mehmed and İsa. Operating from Amasya, Mehmed patiently built his strength. He  first proposed that he and İsa divide Anatolia between them, but İsa, holding the prestigious  capital of Bursa, refused.4 The inevitable clash came at the Battle of Ulubat. Mehmed&#x27;s forces  were victorious, and he entered Bursa in 1404, declaring himself the sovereign of Ottoman  Anatolia.4  İsa fled to Constantinople, becoming a pawn in the larger dynastic game. Süleyman, now  recognizing Mehmed as his principal rival, provided İsa with an army to retake Anatolia.  However, the people of Bursa remained loyal to Mehmed, and İsa&#x27;s attempt failed. After  seeking further alliances with other Anatolian beys, İsa made a final, unsuccessful bid for  power. He was eventually captured and strangled by Mehmed&#x27;s men in 1406, his body brought  to Bursa for burial.4 With this victory, Mehmed eliminated his first rival and solidified his  control over the Ottoman heartland in Anatolia.    The Grand Gambit: Unleashing Mûsa on Rumeli (1409-1411)    Mehmed&#x27;s success in Anatolia prompted a direct response from Süleyman, who crossed the  straits with a powerful army, captured Bursa and Ankara, and forced Mehmed to retreat to his  Amasya stronghold.2 Outmatched in a direct confrontation, Mehmed executed a brilliant and  decisive strategic maneuver. He located his other brother, Mûsa Çelebi, who had been  released from Timurid captivity and was residing with the Karamanoğlu bey, and dispatched  him to Rumeli in 1409. The plan was for Mûsa, with support from Wallachia, to open a second  front and challenge Süleyman in his own European territories.4  The gambit worked perfectly. Mûsa&#x27;s arrival in the Balkans rallied support from disgruntled  frontier lords and Christian vassals, including the Serbs and Wallachians.4 The threat to his  capital forced Süleyman to abandon his successful Anatolian campaign and rush back to  Edirne. This withdrawal allowed Mehmed to reoccupy Bursa and Ankara unopposed.4 In  Rumeli, after a series of battles where allegiances shifted dramatically, Mûsa&#x27;s forces  eventually cornered Süleyman as he tried to flee to Constantinople. He was captured and  executed in February 1411.4 Mûsa promptly declared himself the new Sultan in Edirne.    The Final Confrontation: Mehmed vs. Mûsa (1411-1413)    With İsa and Süleyman dead, the eleven-year struggle entered its final phase between the two  remaining brothers. Mûsa, however, quickly proved to be a harsh and erratic ruler. He broke  his pact with Mehmed and launched aggressive campaigns against his erstwhile allies, Serbia  and the Byzantine Empire, going so far as to besiege Constantinople.4 His appointment of the  radical mystic Sheikh Bedreddin as his chief military judge (  kazasker) further alienated the traditional Ottoman military and religious establishment.4  Mûsa&#x27;s aggressive policies drove his former supporters directly into Mehmed&#x27;s camp. Emperor  Manuel II, the Serbian Despot Stefan Lazarević, and influential Rumelian frontier commanders  like Gazi Evrenos Bey all allied with Mehmed, viewing him as the more stable and predictable  alternative.4 Aided by the Byzantine fleet, which ferried his troops across the straits, Mehmed  launched his final campaign into Rumeli.4 The decisive battle was fought on July 5, 1413, in the  Çamurlu plain near modern-day Sofia, Bulgaria. Mûsa&#x27;s army, abandoned by many of its  commanders, was defeated. Mûsa was captured while trying to flee and was executed.4 With  the death of his last brother, Mehmed Çelebi became the sole and undisputed ruler of the  reunited Ottoman domains, formally ending the  Fetret Devri.11  Year(s)  Key Events  Anatolia  (Controlling  Prince/Faction)  Rumeli  (Controlling  Prince/Faction)  Key  Alliances/Treaties  1402  Battle of Ankara;  Bayezid I captured  by Timur.

The survival of the Ottoman dynasty through this period of near-total collapse can be  attributed significantly to the strength of its institutions in Rumeli. While Timur&#x27;s invasion  effectively reversed a generation of Ottoman conquests in Anatolia by restoring the Turkish  beyliks, the Ottoman administrative and military presence in the Balkans proved far more  resilient.1 The economic resources and military manpower of the European provinces  sustained the warring princes and provided the ultimate foundation from which the state  could be rebuilt.1 The fact that Edirne, not the old capital of Bursa, served as the center of  power for Süleyman, Mûsa, and finally Mehmed underscores the westward shift in the  empire&#x27;s center of gravity and the critical role Rumeli played in its restoration.  Furthermore, the civil war itself acted as a catalyst for a crucial development in Ottoman  political culture: the birth of an official historiography. The unprecedented act of fratricide on  such a scale required a new form of justification beyond the traditional legitimacy derived  from holy war (ghaza). Works composed in Mehmed I&#x27;s court were deliberately crafted to  legitimize his victory and justify his actions against his brothers, marking the beginning of a  state-sponsored literary tradition aimed at shaping historical memory to serve dynastic  interests.5    Part II: The Architect of Restoration: Domestic Policy  and State Consolidation    Emerging as the victor in 1413, Mehmed I faced the monumental task of governing a state  ravaged by more than a decade of civil war and social upheaval.17 His eight-year reign was  defined by a deliberate and systematic policy of consolidation, centralization, and  legitimation, aimed at restoring internal order and rebuilding the institutional foundations of  the empire.    Re-establishing Central Authority    The primary objective of Mehmed I&#x27;s domestic policy was to reinstate effective central  authority over a fragmented realm.16 He moved to secure the loyalty of the military and  administrative elites who had been divided during the Interregnum, establishing a more  organized and disciplined state apparatus.16 In the Balkans, he initially pursued a policy of  &quot;relative restraint,&quot; restoring the vassal system rather than attempting immediate, large-scale  annexations, a pragmatic approach that allowed him to secure his European frontiers while  focusing on more pressing issues.9  A key, and perhaps the most consequential, institutional development of his reign was the  formal implementation of the devşirme system. This practice involved the levy of Christian  boys from the Balkan provinces, who were then converted to Islam and trained for service in  the elite Janissary corps or the palace administration.18 While its origins are debated, sources  indicate that the system was put into practice during Mehmed&#x27;s reign to supplement the  pençik system (which entitled the sultan to one-fifth of war captives).21 The  pençik had become an unreliable source of manpower during the Interregnum due to the lack  of major foreign conquests. The devşirme, by contrast, provided a regular and systematic  supply of soldiers and officials—known as kapıkulları (slaves of the Porte)—whose loyalty was  exclusively to the person of the sultan, not to regional or tribal interests.21 This was a direct  institutional response to the unreliability of the Turkish notable families, whose allegiances  had shifted frequently during the civil war, and it became a cornerstone of Ottoman  centralization for centuries to come.    Economic and Social Recovery    Mehmed&#x27;s reign was a period of deliberate peace and reconstruction, allowing the battered  provinces of Anatolia and Rumeli to heal the wounds of the long conflict.16 His policies aligned  with the fundamental economic priority of the Ottoman state: ensuring the provisioning of the  capital, major cities, and the army to maintain political stability and social order.24 The  restoration of central authority was a prerequisite for the recovery of agriculture and trade,  the twin pillars of the state&#x27;s tax revenue.19  To facilitate this recovery and to project an image of a pious, just, and benevolent ruler,  Mehmed I became a significant patron of public works.26 He commissioned the construction  of mosques,  madrasas (schools), and imarets (refectories for the poor) in the empire&#x27;s major cities,  particularly Bursa and Edirne.11 These projects not only fulfilled crucial social and religious  functions but also stimulated local economies through construction and employment, visibly  demonstrating the return of stability and prosperity under his rule.    Legitimacy in Stone and Tile: The Political Significance of the Yeşil  Külliye    The crowning achievement of Mehmed I&#x27;s reign and the most potent symbol of his program of  restoration is the Yeşil Külliye (Green Complex) in the former capital of Bursa.28 Commissioned  by the sultan and constructed between 1412 and 1424 under the supervision of his trusted  vizier Hacı İvaz Pasha, the complex was a sophisticated instrument of political legitimation.28  The complex was a deliberate and powerful statement symbolizing the &quot;rebirth of the  Ottoman rule&quot; after the devastation of the Interregnum.32 Its architectural grandeur and the  unparalleled quality of its tilework were intended to demonstrate that the restored dynasty  was not merely a shadow of its former self but was capable of producing artistic and  architectural marvels that surpassed those of the pre-Ankara era.35 This &quot;boastful rhetoric of  the buildings&quot; was a calculated projection of power and stability that stood in stark contrast to  the political fragility Mehmed had inherited.36 In a highly unusual architectural choice, the  Green Tomb (  Yeşil Türbe), Mehmed&#x27;s mausoleum, was built on a hill overlooking the mosque. This has been  interpreted as a conscious political message to &quot;friend and foe&quot; that the Ottoman dynasty  was &quot;still standing&quot; tall despite its recent trials.35  The complex also served to legitimize Mehmed&#x27;s rule in the wake of the fratricidal civil war and  to counter criticisms of his relative youth.36 Architecturally, it consciously referenced earlier  Ottoman and even frontier  ghazi traditions, thereby visually asserting dynastic continuity and Mehmed&#x27;s rightful place as  the heir to his father, Bayezid I.36 The artistic program of the complex was equally significant.  The magnificent tile decorations were created by a group of artisans known as the &quot;Masters  of Tabriz,&quot; who brought with them the sophisticated techniques and aesthetics of the  Timurid-Persian world.28 The adoption of this &quot;International Timurid-Turkmen style&quot; was a  profound political act.36 By appropriating and mastering the artistic language of the very  empire that had nearly destroyed them, Mehmed I was visually asserting the Ottoman state&#x27;s  own imperial status and cultural sophistication on an international stage. This architectural  patronage was not simply a matter of aesthetics; it was a form of political warfare and a key  component of his strategy for state-building.    Part III: Trials of a New Order: Internal Threats to the  Sultanate    Mehmed I&#x27;s victory in 1413 brought unity but not absolute stability. His reign was immediately  tested by two major internal rebellions that exposed the deep social, religious, and political  fissures that the Interregnum had widened. These challenges revealed that the consolidation  of the Ottoman state was far from complete.    The Rebellion of Sheikh Bedreddin (1416)    The most formidable internal threat to Mehmed&#x27;s rule came from Sheikh Bedreddin, a  charismatic and highly respected Islamic scholar and mystic who had served as Mûsa Çelebi&#x27;s  chief military judge (kazasker).11 The rebellion he inspired was a complex socio-religious  movement with deep roots in the turmoil of the preceding decades.  Bedreddin&#x27;s ideology was a form of populist, syncretic Sufism that was deeply subversive to  the emerging Ottoman state orthodoxy. He preached the &quot;oneness of being,&quot; a doctrine that  advocated for the communal ownership of property and the equality of all people, including  Muslims and Christians, arguing that social and religious divisions were artificial barriers to  unity with God.14 This message found a receptive audience among the diverse populations  who felt disenfranchised by the centralizing Ottoman state. The rebellion was fueled by the  widespread economic misery and social dislocation that followed the Timurid invasion and the  civil war.41 Bedreddin became the figurehead for a heterogeneous coalition that included  nomadic Turcomans resentful of state control, Christian peasants, dispossessed soldiers who  had lost their land grants (  timars) after Mûsa&#x27;s defeat, and disgruntled frontier lords.14  In 1416, the movement erupted into open revolt on two fronts simultaneously. In western  Anatolia, Bedreddin&#x27;s disciples Börklüce Mustafa and Torlak Kemal led uprisings in the regions  of Karaburun and Manisa. At the same time, Bedreddin himself, having fled his exile in Iznik to  Wallachia, raised the standard of revolt in Dobruja in the Balkans.14 The coordinated nature of  these uprisings posed a serious challenge to Mehmed&#x27;s authority.14 The Ottoman response  was swift and brutal. The Grand Vizier Bayezid Pasha was dispatched to Anatolia, where he  crushed the revolts with merciless force. Börklüce Mustafa and thousands of his followers  were executed.14 Bedreddin&#x27;s own rebellion in the Balkans was quickly suppressed. He was  captured, brought before the Sultan in Serres, and, after a summary trial, was hanged in the  marketplace in 1420.14 The violent suppression of this movement marked a definitive moment  in Ottoman history, solidifying the state&#x27;s commitment to Sunni orthodoxy and its intolerance  of popular movements that challenged its political and religious authority.    The Pretender: The &quot;Düzmece&quot; Mustafa Affair (1415-1417)    Concurrent with the Bedreddin revolt, Mehmed faced a dynastic challenge from his brother,  Mustafa Çelebi. Mustafa had been captured at the Battle of Ankara and taken to Samarkand  by Timur.11 He re-emerged around 1415, claiming his rightful share of the Ottoman throne. To  undermine his legitimacy, Mehmed&#x27;s government launched a propaganda campaign, branding  him  Düzmece Mustafa—&quot;Mustafa the Impostor&quot;.45 Despite this, modern historians largely concur  that he was a genuine son of Bayezid I and thus a legitimate claimant to the throne.45  Mustafa&#x27;s challenge was sustained by a network of foreign and domestic support. He was  backed by the Timurid ruler Shahrukh, the Anatolian beyliks of Karaman and Candar, and the  Voivode of Wallachia, all of whom saw an opportunity to weaken the newly reunified Ottoman  state.45 Most critically, Mustafa sought and received refuge from the Byzantine Emperor  Manuel II in the city of Thessaloniki.11 The Byzantines, continuing their policy of playing  Ottoman princes against one another, used Mustafa as a strategic pawn to exert pressure on  Mehmed.45  Mehmed I responded with a multifaceted strategy. He besieged Thessaloniki to compel the  Byzantines to surrender his brother while simultaneously continuing his propaganda  campaign.45 However, with the Sheikh Bedreddin rebellion raging, he could not afford a  prolonged, multi-front conflict. He therefore shifted to a diplomatic solution. In late 1416 or  early 1417, Mehmed reached a formal agreement with Emperor Manuel II. In return for a  substantial annual payment of 300,000  akçe, the emperor agreed to hold Mustafa in custody on the island of Lemnos for the duration  of Mehmed&#x27;s life.11 This pragmatic arrangement effectively neutralized the immediate threat,  though it ensured that Mustafa would remain a latent danger, one that would re-emerge to  plague Mehmed&#x27;s son and successor, Murad II.  These two rebellions were not isolated incidents but symptoms of the fundamental,  unresolved tensions within the early 15th-century Ottoman polity. The Bedreddin revolt  represented the deep ideological chasm between the centralizing, Sunni-orthodox state and  the syncretic, heterodox culture of the Turcoman nomads and frontier warriors.43 The Mustafa  affair highlighted the inherent instability of the Ottoman succession system, which lacked a  clear rule of primogeniture, and the state&#x27;s continued vulnerability to foreign manipulation of  rival princes.11 These internal and external threats were deeply intertwined; domestic  opponents sought foreign aid, and foreign rivals exploited domestic weaknesses. Mehmed&#x27;s  success lay in his ability to de-escalate the dynastic threat through diplomacy in order to  concentrate overwhelming military force against the social rebellion, demonstrating a  sophisticated grasp of strategic priorities.    Part IV: A World of Rivals and Allies: Foreign Policy and  Diplomacy    Mehmed I&#x27;s foreign policy was a direct and deliberate response to the catastrophes of the  preceding decade. His approach was characterized by caution, pragmatism, and a primary  focus on securing the empire&#x27;s borders to create the peaceful conditions necessary for  internal consolidation.16 This marked a significant departure from the relentless, multi-front  expansionism of his father, Bayezid I.    Pragmatism and Peace: Relations with the Byzantine Empire    The cornerstone of Mehmed&#x27;s foreign policy was his relationship with the Byzantine Emperor  Manuel II Palaiologos.13 Mehmed owed a significant political debt to Manuel, whose naval and  diplomatic support had been crucial in the final campaign against Mûsa Çelebi.9 Upon  securing the throne, Mehmed honored this alliance. He confirmed the terms of the 1403  treaty that his brother Süleyman had signed, acknowledging Byzantine sovereignty over  Thessaloniki and other territories and formally ending the payment of tribute.45  This policy of peace was a strategic necessity. It secured his European flank, neutralized a  potential source of intrigue, and allowed him to concentrate his resources on reunifying  Anatolia and suppressing internal rebellions.16 The relationship was remarkably cordial for a  time, with sources recording a meeting where Mehmed boarded the emperor&#x27;s ship to dine  with him, a sign of considerable mutual trust.45 However, the dynamic was complex. Manuel  continued to skillfully exploit Ottoman weaknesses, most notably by harboring the pretender  Mustafa and using him as leverage until a financial settlement was reached.11 The relationship  was a blend of genuine cooperation and calculated self-interest on both sides. In a final  testament to this complex bond, Mehmed, on his deathbed, arranged to send two of his  younger sons as nominal hostages to Constantinople to ensure Manuel&#x27;s support for the  succession of his chosen heir, Murad II.11    Contest for the Aegean: The Venetian Naval Conflict (1416)    While Mehmed sought peace on land, his reign witnessed the first major naval war between  the Ottomans and the Republic of Venice.55 The conflict was sparked in 1414-1415 by raids  conducted by the Ottoman fleet against Venetian shipping and island possessions in the  Aegean, including the Duchy of Naxos and the colony of Negroponte (Euboea).56  In response, Venice dispatched a fleet under the command of Pietro Loredan. The decisive  engagement occurred on May 29, 1416, off the coast of Gallipoli, the main Ottoman naval  base. The Battle of Gallipoli was a catastrophic defeat for the nascent Ottoman navy. The  Venetian fleet, technologically and tactically superior, destroyed its Ottoman counterpart,  killed the Ottoman admiral, and captured a large number of ships and sailors.11  The battle decisively confirmed Venetian naval supremacy in the Aegean for the next several  decades.56 However, its immediate political impact was limited. Mehmed, focused on  consolidation, was not prepared for a protracted and costly naval war. A peace treaty was  eventually concluded in 1419, which restored Venetian trading privileges.56 The defeat at  Gallipoli was a sobering lesson that underscored the limits of Ottoman power at sea and  reinforced Mehmed&#x27;s overarching policy of avoiding unnecessary conflicts with major  European powers while his state was still recovering.    Securing the Frontiers: The Balkans and Anatolia    Mehmed&#x27;s policies in Anatolia and the Balkans were distinct, tailored to the different strategic  realities of each region.  ●​ The Balkans: In Europe, he focused on re-establishing Ottoman suzerainty through the  vassal system, a cost-effective method of securing the frontier without direct and  expensive occupation.61 He conducted a campaign in 1416 that reduced Wallachia to a  tributary state and made territorial gains in Albania in 1417.9 He maintained his alliance  with Serbia, which had been instrumental in his victory over Mûsa.18 This approach  created a buffer zone of dependent states, ensuring stability on his western border  while minimizing military commitment.  ●​ Anatolia: In contrast, Mehmed&#x27;s primary military efforts were directed at the direct  re-annexation of the Turkish beyliks. He brought the principalities of Aydın, Menteşe,  and Saruhan back under Ottoman rule.18 He launched campaigns that reduced the  powerful Karamanid emirate, based in Konya, to submission and also subjugated the  Candar (Jandarid) emirate in northern Anatolia.9 This policy was essential for reuniting  the Turkish heartland of the empire, restoring the territorial integrity that had been lost  in 1402, and securing his eastern flank from powerful rivals like the Karamanids.18  This deliberate reversal of his father&#x27;s policies reveals a profound lesson learned from the  disaster at Ankara. Where Bayezid had pursued relentless and simultaneous expansion,  Mehmed prioritized, compartmentalized, and de-escalated conflicts. His reign marks a  significant maturation in Ottoman statecraft, where the ruler was not just a ghazi warrior but  also a shrewd statesman for whom diplomacy and political calculation were primary  instruments of power.13    Conclusion: The Legacy of the Second Founder      Death and Succession (1421)    Sultan Mehmed I&#x27;s reign of restoration came to an end on May 26, 1421, in Edirne. At the age  of approximately 35, he died, according to various sources, either from a stroke, a cerebral  hemorrhage, or injuries sustained in a hunting accident.9  The memory of the Fetret Devri loomed so large that his court took extraordinary measures to  prevent another succession crisis. His death was kept secret from the public and the army for  40 days, allowing time for his designated heir, the 17-year-old Murad II, to travel from his  provincial governorship in Amasya and securely ascend the throne in Bursa.11 This elaborate  concealment, the first of its kind in Ottoman history, was a direct legacy of the trauma of the  Interregnum and a testament to the court&#x27;s deep-seated fear of a renewed civil war.67 Despite  these precautions, Murad II&#x27;s accession was immediately challenged by the pretender  Mustafa, who was released by the Byzantines, and by his own younger brother, Küçük  Mustafa, demonstrating the persistent fragility of the dynastic line.68    Final Assessment: The Second Founder (İkinci Kurucu)    The title &quot;second founder,&quot; widely applied to Mehmed I by both contemporary and modern  historians, is a fitting tribute to the magnitude of his achievement.11 At the beginning of his  struggle for the throne in 1402, the Ottoman state was a ruin—a collection of warring  principalities on the verge of extinction, its Anatolian heartland lost, and its sultan a captive.3  By his death in 1421, Mehmed had resurrected the empire. He had reunified Anatolia and  Rumeli under a single, central authority and restored its territory to nearly its pre-Ankara  borders.9  He did not simply inherit a state; he rebuilt it from its foundations. He ended the civil war,  re-established a functioning administration, suppressed powerful internal revolts that  threatened the state&#x27;s social and political fabric, and secured the empire&#x27;s borders through a  pragmatic and cautious foreign policy.16 His role was so pivotal that historians have compared  him to the Prophet Noah, who saved believers with his ark from the flood of destruction that  had engulfed the world.23    Enduring Impact    Mehmed I&#x27;s most crucial legacy was the stable, reunified, and revitalized state he bequeathed  to his son, Murad II.16 His eight-year reign of consolidation was the essential prerequisite for  the great expansionist phase of Ottoman history that followed. Without Mehmed&#x27;s patient  reconstruction, the subsequent conquests of Murad II in the Balkans and, ultimately, the  capture of Constantinople in 1453 by his grandson, Mehmed II, would have been  inconceivable.16  He transformed the trauma of the Interregnum into a series of institutional and political  lessons that would shape the classical Ottoman Empire. His reign saw the beginning of a  pivotal shift away from a state reliant on the ghazi ethos and the often-fickle loyalty of Turkish  notables toward a centralized, bureaucratic empire built upon a new slave elite (kapıkulları)  created through the devşirme system. He demonstrated the critical importance of diplomacy  and narrative legitimation as tools of statecraft. The &quot;second founding&quot; was therefore not just  a political restoration but an ideological and structural evolution, establishing the resilient  framework that would allow the Ottoman Empire to endure for another five centuries.
